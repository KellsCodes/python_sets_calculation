# Statistical Sets in Python
__This script is used to calculate the following set problems in statistics:__
* Union of sets: three different sets of numbers required
* Intersection of sets
* Set disjoint
Each result is shown to the user on the console, along the inputs

You can also find scripts to:
==> check if a number is a prime number
==> check if a word is a palindrome
==> find the factorial of a number

For each of these scripts, the user can execute the file by entering the following command on the console or terminal

__./NAME_OF_THE_FILE__

Then the user is prompted for an input, enter the input as prompted.
If the input is invalid, an error is thrown to the user and user will kept being prompted until a corrrect input is entered.
